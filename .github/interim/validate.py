"""Hold `plugin.toml` to what lemonfiber publishes, and to nothing written here.

**This is CI harness, not plugin content.** A plugin is `plugin.toml` and
`fixtures/`; nothing under `.github/` is part of what an operator installs, and
nothing here is ever run by lemonfiber (`F3-R6`).

**Nothing in this file describes the manifest format.** Which tables a manifest
may carry, which fields each one takes, of what kind, out of which closed set and
within which bounds is `plugin-manifest.schema.json`'s to say. That schema is
generated from the types lemonfiber deserialises (`ARCH-R92`), published with
every release, and is the same document lemonfiber's own conformance stage walks
a manifest against before it parses one — so an off-the-shelf reader and the
binary reach the same verdict about the shape of a file. `F3-R2` asks for exactly
that, and `F10-R2` forbids a second, hand-maintained description standing beside
it.

One stood here, and the reason that mattered is not tidiness. It had drifted from
the reader in both directions. It refused a `version` that is not semver, a
`hostname` that is not a DNS label, a `dashboard_group` outside four words, a
`form` or a `media_type` outside two lists copied off the stack, an upper-case
digest, a recipe carrying no step, a captured value whose `origin` was outside
four words, and a set of proofs that only ever read a status — and lemonfiber
refuses none of those. An author who changed a manifest to satisfy it changed it
for no reason, and an author who could not was stuck on a rule nobody had
written down anywhere else.

What is left restates nothing the schema states. It is the reader's own
refusals — what lemonfiber decides *after* a file has been accepted as a
manifest — in the one place they can be asked before the reader exists:

  * what lemonfiber publishes elsewhere — which capability names exist, which
    points a contribution may be made at, and what a row at one carries;
  * what spans two places in the document — a claim and the `provides` it
    answers, a remedy and the check it names, a substitution and the step that
    captured it;
  * what needs the source on disk — a recording a binding names;
  * what a value means rather than what shape it is — a digest that fixes what
    runs, an image that carries no second pin, a configuration directory that is
    not the library, a call that names something rather than somewhere and uses
    a verb a runner could make.

Every rule here was read off `lemonfiber-plugin` before it was written. Being
weaker than the reader is what a stand-in is; disagreeing with it is the defect,
so a rule that refused something lemonfiber accepts has been deleted rather than
kept, and nothing is added here without checking the reader first.

    validate.py --published <dir>  the manifest, against the three artefacts
    validate.py                    the rules no published artefact decides
    validate.py --self-test        each rule refuses the shape it exists to refuse

The three are fetched by `published_gate.py`; this reads them off a directory so
that the catalogue can supply its own copy. Every violation is reported in one
pass, each naming its location (`ARCH-R94`, `F1-R9`, `F10-R10`). Exit 0 =
conforms, 1 = does not.
