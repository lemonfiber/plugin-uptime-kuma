"""Validate `plugin.toml` against the manifest contract — until a schema exists.

**This is CI harness, not plugin content.** A plugin is `plugin.toml` and
`fixtures/`; nothing under `.github/` is part of what an operator installs, and
nothing here is ever run by lemonfiber (`F3-R6`).

`F3-R2` requires a manifest to be validated against a **published schema**, and
`ARCH-R92` requires that schema to be *generated from the types lemonfiber
deserialises* and published with every release. No release publishes one yet:
the plugin machinery is `0.16.0`, which is `planned`. So there is nothing to
validate against, and the honest options are to report this plugin unvalidated
or to check it against the contract by hand.

This does the second and says so. It is deliberately **not** a schema and must
never be published as one: `F10-R2` forbids a second, hand-maintained
description of the manifest format precisely because it can disagree with the
parser, and a plugin that validates in an author's editor and is refused on an
operator's machine is the failure that rule exists to prevent. When the schema
is published, `ci.yml` switches to it and this file is deleted — and until then
`schema_gate.py` is what fails the day it appears.

Two of the things a manifest declares into are **published by lemonfiber** and
not describable here at all: the core capability vocabulary and the extension
points. Which names exist is lemonfiber's to say, so every rule that depends on
knowing them is skipped without `--published <dir>` and **reported as skipped**
rather than passed — a validator that quietly checked less than it claimed is
the same defect as a stand-in that outlives what it stood in for.

    validate.py                    the rules that need nothing outside this file
    validate.py --published <dir>  those, and every rule the published artefacts decide
    validate.py --self-test        each rule refuses the shape it exists to refuse

Every violation is reported in one pass, each naming its location (`ARCH-R94`,
`F1-R9`, `F10-R10`). Exit 0 = conforms, 1 = does not.
